<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Week 11: Recap of the linear model and practising data-wrangling in R</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Written by Margriet Groen (partly adapted from materials developed by the PsyTeachR team a the University of Glasgow)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before we start covering new material, we want to spent some time on recapping the basic concepts of the linear model (correlation, simple regression, multiple regression). You all come from different educational backgrounds and therefore have vastly different knowledge of, and experience with statistics. Therefore, please follow your own judgement as to whether you feel you want to/need to revisit material outlining the theoretical background to and the practical implementation in R for these topics. Below we provide some guidance as to materials that are relevant. <strong>Just to be clear: We don’t expect you to watch and/or read and/or do everything, please have a look at what you feel you need and spend some time with those materials.</strong></p>
<div id="lectures" class="section level2" number="2.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Lectures</h2>
<p><strong>The linear model was discussed in weeks 6 to 9 of PSYC401, so that is a good place to start.</strong></p>
<p>Alternatively, if you don’t feel confident about the material, these recorded lectures might help.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/5fecb3a3-3bfe-4a00-a2fe-d463baac4820"><strong>The linear model: theory (~30 min)</strong></a>

In this video I demonstrate how to build a linear model in R by talking you through a simple linear regression script (you can download it here <a href="files/week11/stats_linearModel_howTo.R">stats_linearModel_howTo.R</a>). If you are unclear on what different parts of the lm() function do, or how to read the output, this video might help clarify that.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/c7fb276c-4d06-40d4-8553-ec775f9ecdc6"><strong>Multiple regression: theory (~35 min)</strong></a>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Reading</h2>
<div id="miller-haden-2013" class="section level3" number="2.2.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> Miller &amp; Haden (2013)</h3>
<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1fyuTuvj3YoaFdUR3FZaXNuNXc/view"><strong>Link</strong></a>
Chapters 10 to 12 from this free textbook provide a basic, but accessible overview. Chapter 10 gives you a brief overview of what correlation and regression are. Chapter 11 introduces correlation in more detail. Chapter 12 provides an accessible overview of simple regression. All three chapters are really short but provide a good basis to understanding. We consider this the minimum level of understanding you should acquire.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 4</strong> provides and excellent conceptual introduction to the linear model and also explains how this is implemented in R (highly recommended).</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 5</strong> takes a slightly different approach to the one taken in Miller &amp; Haden (2013) to introducing correlation. If you already understand the basic theory behind correlation, this will be an interesting read. Chapter 5 also clearly explains what centering and standardizing are and why you need to bother with these linear transformations.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 6</strong> provides an excellent overview of multiple regression and also explains how this is implemented in R.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Pre-lab activities</h2>
<p>After having watched the lectures and read the textbook chapters you’ll be in a good position to try these activities. Completing them before you attend your lab session will help you to consolidate your learning and help move through the lab activities more smoothly.</p>
<div id="pre-lab-activity-1-visualising-the-regression-line" class="section level3" number="2.3.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.1</span> Pre-lab activity 1: Visualising the regression line</h3>
<p>Have a look at <a href="https://ryansafner.shinyapps.io/ols_estimation_by_min_sse/"><strong>this visualisation of the regression line</strong></a> by Ryan Safner.</p>
<p>In this shiny app, you see a randomly-generated set of data points (within specific parameters, to keep the graph scaled properly). You can choose a slope and intercept for the regression line by using the sliders. The graph also displays the residuals as dashed red lines. Moving the slope or the intercept too much causes the generated line to create much larger residuals. The shiny app also calculates the sum of squared errors (SSE) and the standard error of the regression (SER), which calculates the average size of the error (the red numbers). These numbers reflect how well the regression line fits the data, but you don’t need to worry about those for now.</p>
<p>In the app he uses the equation Y = aX + b in which b is the intercept and a is the slope.</p>
<p>This is slightly different from the equation you saw during the lecture. There we talked about Y = b0 + b1*X + e. Same equation, just different letters. So b0 in the lecture is equivalent to b in the app and b1 in the lecture is equivalent to a in the app.</p>
<p>Pre-lab activity questions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Change the slider for the intercept. How does it change the regression line?</li>
<li>Change the slider for the slope. How does it change the regression line?</li>
<li>What happens to the residuals (the red dashed lines) when you change the slope and the intercept of the regression line?</li>
</ol>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.2</span> Pre-lab activity 2: Data-wrangling in R</h3>
<p>In PSYC401, you’ve already learned how to read in data, how to select variables and how to compute summary statistics, so re-visiting the PSYC401 materials is a good place to start.</p>
<p>RStudio also provides some useful interactive tutorials that take you through the basics:</p>
<p>*<a href="https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/1"><strong>The Basics</strong></a> Start here to learn how to inspect, visualize, subset and transform your data, as well as how to run code.</p>
<p>*<a href="https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/2"><strong>Work with Data</strong></a> Learn how to extract values form a table, subset tables, calculate summary statistics, and derive new variables.</p>
<p>*<a href="https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/3"><strong>Visualize Data</strong></a> Learn how to use ggplot2 to make any type of plot with your data. The tutorials on <a href="https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/3.1"><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis</strong></a> and <a href="https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/3.5"><strong>Scatterplots</strong></a> are particularly relevant.</p>
<p>Please note that there are often different ways to do the same or similar things in R. This means you might encounter slightly different functions in different materials. This is not something to worry about. Just make sure you’re clear on what a bit of code achieves and choose the function that you feel most comfortable with.</p>

<p>When you have completed all of the lab content, you may want to check your answers with our completed version of the script for this week. <strong>Remember</strong>, looking at this script (studying/revising it) does not replace the process of working through the lab activities, trying them out for yourself, getting stuck, asking questions, finding solutions, adding your own comments, etc. <strong>Actively engaging</strong> with the material is the way to learn these analysis skills, not by looking at someone else’s completed code…</p>
<p>The answer script will be available after the final lab session has taken place.</p>
