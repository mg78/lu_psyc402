# Lab activity 1: Visual dominance

# Research question: Do English speakers use 'visual' adjectives more frequently than
# adjectives more strongly associated with other sensory modalities?


#### Step 1: Set up
# Clear the environment

# Load libraries

# Read in the data

# Have a look at the data

  
#### Step 2: A bit of data wrangling

# Combine the data from the two data files and select the relevant variables

# Get positive integeres (i.e., raw values):


#### Step 3: Visualise the data


#### Step 4: The regression model
# Fit Poisson regression with continuous predictors


#### Step 5: Overdispersion
# Fit negative binomial regression

# See whether negative binomial regression is warranted.
